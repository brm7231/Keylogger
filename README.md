## About
I created this keylogger from scratch because I was bored. Please do not misuse this software: it is only for educational purposes!

## Directions
- There are a few 3rd Party modules that you will need to install to the path for your project
- Once you have installed the necessary modules, you will be able to compile the `logger.pyw`
- For compilation, you will need to run the following commands in cmd (see https://www.devdungeon.com/content/pyinstaller-tutorial for more details)
~~~
pip install pyinstaller
cd (path_of_folder_where_logger.pyw_located)
pyinstaller --onefile logger.pyw
~~~
- You may run the`logger.exe` file in `bin`
- Email usernames and password will need to be updated for code to work properly
- Windows Defender will need to be disabled for this program to run
