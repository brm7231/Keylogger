## About
I created this keylogger from scratch because I was bored. Please do not misuse this software: it is only for educational purposes!

## Directions
- All necessary 3rd Party modules are included so you can edit the `logger.pyw` and compile
- For compilation, you will need to run the following commands in cmd
~~~
pip install pyinstaller
cd (path_of_folder_where_logger.pyw_located)
pyinstaller --onefile logger.pyw
~~~
- You may run the`logger.exe` file in `bin`
- Email usernames and password will need to be updated for code to work properly
- Windows Defender will need to be disabled for this program to run
